<h3>Hello!</h3>

<p>
This is the first time I'm using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to do anything.
<br>
Prior to this, I used to utilize things like iFrames and JavaScripts. iFrames have problems of their own. For instance, every time you want to link to something, you have to add the attribute "target='_parent'", which could get really annoying sometimes. With JavaScript, there was the possibility that someone could disable it in their browser to save memory. What's someone with little-to-none patience left to do?
<br>
That's when I figured out how to use Jekyll. I was initially only going to use it for the **ramble** section (you are here), but since all I have to do is type into a markdown (or HTML) file, I thought, hey, why not just use it on the whole website so I can just type in *even less* lines of code? So I did, and here we are.

<h5>video doesn't really work well in jekyll so yeah let's use HTML instead to show a video that makes fun of the name of Jekyll</h5>
